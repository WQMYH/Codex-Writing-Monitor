## Active execution

- Automation: `writing-ops` (`推进 Writing Ops 工程实施`), active, two-minute heartbeat.
- Execution mode: SkillFlow inline implementation with a fresh independent reviewer at every milestone.
- Git branch: `feat/writing-ops-v1`.
- Installed probe identity is returned at runtime as both the cachebuster version and a SHA-256 build identifier; the frozen CommitSet records the exact installed version.
- Verified M0 surface: cached stdio MCP, `writing_dashboard`, structured text fallback, app resource discovery, fixed dashboard task, and scheduled-task plugin visibility.
- Honest limitation: the current Codex host did not expose enough evidence to prove that the MCP Apps React component rendered; M0 therefore supports the text renderer and records component rendering as unverified. An existing task remains bound to the plugin snapshot it was created with, so installation upgrades require a replacement/reloaded fixed task.
- Runtime support claim: none yet; M0 does not start Storyforge, Edge, browser-use, or a writing run.
